My name is Eric LaRue.  I live in Salem, OR with my wife and two children.  I am currently studying Computer Science at Oregon State University, and I have a previous degree from Berklee College of Music.  In addition to my studies, I am interested in learning Unity 3D, C#, Swift, and iOS development, as well as music production with Digital Performer and all of the various synths in Native Instruments Complete and Maschine.

Programming background
During my coursework at Oregon State, my programming experience has largely been in C.  My first courses were taught using C++.  I have also had experience in MASM, HTML, Javascript, PHP, and SQL.
