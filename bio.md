My name is Eric LaRue.  I live in Salem, OR with my wife and two children.  I am currently studying Computer Science at Oregon State University, and I have a previous degree from Berklee College of Music.  In addition to my studies, I am interested in learning Unity 3D, C#, Swift, and iOS development, as well as music production with Digital Performer and all of the various synths in Native Instruments Complete and Maschine.

Prior to moving to Salem, I lived in Newark, NJ and commuted to Manhattan to work for TransPerfect Translations, a job I had since 2008.  I left that job in September of 2014, while in the midst of my OSU CS program, and moved to Salem, where I have been studying full time ever since.

Programming background
During my coursework at Oregon State, my programming experience has largely been in C.  My first courses were taught using C++.  I have also had experience in MASM, HTML, Javascript, PHP, and SQL.

In the immediate future, I have registered to take some extracurricular tutorials in Java, Python, Ruby, Unity 3D, and C#.
